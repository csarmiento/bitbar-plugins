Speedtest bitbar plugin

* Python comes pre-installed on Mac OS X so it is easy to start using.
* Make sure you have [`pip`](http://softwaretester.info/install-and-upgrade-pip-on-mac-os-x/) installed and on your `$PATH`.
* Add [`speedtest-cli`](https://github.com/sivel/speedtest-cli) that is a command line interface for testing internet bandwidth using speedtest.net.
